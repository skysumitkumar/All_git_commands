git reset - -soft showid ->To move head to any commit and remove upper ommits
				here modification will show as staged in staging index

Here’s how you can use Git LFS to track and push large files:

Install Git LFS: You can download Git LFS from https://git-lfs.github.com/ and install it on your system.

Initialize Git LFS: Run the following command in your repository:

Step1:-git lfs install

Track the Large File: Add the large file type (e.g., PDF) to Git LFS:

Step2:-git lfs track fullFilePath

Alternatively, you can track specific files by providing their paths.
Add and Commit Changes: After tracking the file, commit the changes:

Step3:-git add .gitattributes
Step3:-git add placement_data/DBMS/Notes/DBMS_Full_Notes.pdf
Step3:-git commit -m "Track large file with Git LFS"

Push Changes to GitHub: Now you can push the changes to GitHub as usual:

Step4:-git push origin main
